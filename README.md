# Retropie Vertical Overlays
Vertical arcade overlays for Retropie.
These assume you are rotating the screen to avoid performance issues.  This is why all the PNGs are rotated to the right.

## Credits
The CoinOPS Project without their source material this would not have been possible.
Special shoutout to the team over there BritneysPAIRS, Pipmick and of course gjsmsmith who created much of the art used in making the overlays.

## Usage
It's always a good idea to make a backup before changing your build.  So do that now!

Copy the files to the appropriate folders and restart emulation station.
